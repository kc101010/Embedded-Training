## CPU
Executes instructions

consists of:
+ Control Unit (CU) - handling scheduling, controlling I/O
+ Arithmetic & Logic Unit (ALU) - main processing area, arithmetic and logic
+ Registers (Immediate access store) - limited space, high-speed memory for quick processing. Found directly on CPU. 

To hardware, data is simply a series of binary electrical pulses which run though different wires, semiconductors and comonents to process and return data.

## Memory

RAM - short-term, volatile storage.
Hard disks - long-term, permanent file storage.

### Buses
Bus - engineering terms for a job-specific high-speed wire. Often group together in bundles and transfer signals in parallel or serial. Main bus types in hardware are data, address and control. 

Data bus: carry data between CPU and other components. Bi-directional.
Address bus: carry specific mem address. Uni-directional. 
Control bus: Unidirecitonal. Carry control singal of CU to other components as well as sync clock signals. 

## Motherboard
Holds CPU, hard-drive, USB devices and more (connected through ports to allow for easy communciation).

Port - physical outlet for I/O devices.
