4 main computer functions that facilitate computer interaction/handling;
+ Input
+ Processing
+ Memory 
+ Output

## Input 
Physical interaction, giving commands. These are then turned into data.
Inputs connected through a physical port attached to motherboard.

Input device's job is detecting and reporting all/any events; clicks etc.
Input data is then sent to the CPU for processing.

## Processing
Computing figuring out instructions and executing requests.

## Memory
Using RAM to store data which is used in processing and so on. 

## Output
After processing data, CPU then send intructions on how to handle it which results in output.
