# Potential Divider

## GPT - Electric Potential AKA Voltage.

Measure of potential/possible energy per unit of electric charge at a certain point in an electric field. Like a measure of the push or pull a charge would feel at that point. 

Tells us how much potential energy an electric charge would have if it were placed at a specific location in an electric field.

[Electric potential - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_potential)

Amount of work/energy needed per unit of electric charge to move the charge from a reference point to a specific point in an electric field.

2 Resistors in series.

The total potential difference is divided between the 2 resistors according to the ratio of their resistances. Resistor values allow potential difference across resistances to be varied.

## GPT - Potential Divider
Resistors are arranged in a circuit to allow the input voltage to be divided into a smaller output voltage. Like having a water pipe with 2 different sized openings. 

Output voltage is taken from the connection between the 2 resistors and is determined by the ratio of the 2 resistors. The larger the ratio of the second resistor to the sum of both resistors, the smaller the output voltage.
