Passive component which consists of 2 or more pieces of conducting material which is separated by an insulating material. This gives the 'capacity' to store energy as an electrical charge which produces a potential difference (static voltage) across it's plates (Similar to a small rechargeable battery).

There are various different capacitors but all have the same use; To store a charge.

Its most basic form consists of 2 or more parallel conductive (metal) plates which aren't connected/touching but instead electrically separated either by air or strong insulator (may be waxed paper, ceramic, plastic, liquid gel). The insulating layer between capacitor plates is the *Dielectric*. This layer prevents DC current from flowing by blocking it, this allows a voltage to be present across the plates in the form of an electrical charge. 

When used in a DC (Direct Current) circuit, a capacitor charges up to its supply voltage but blocks the current from flowing through it (as the Dielectric is a non-conductive insulator). When a capacitor is connected to an AC (Alternating Current) Circuit, current flow is able to pass through the capacitor with little to no resistance. 

There are 2 types of electrical charge; 
Positive charge (Protons)
Negative charge (Electrons)

When DC voltage is placed across a capacitor, the positive (+ve) charge quickly accumulates on one plate while a corresponding, opposite negative charge (-ve) accumulates on the other plate. For every +ve charged particle that arrives at one plate, a charge of the same sign will depart from the same sign will depart from the -ve plate.

The plates will then remain charge neutral and, because of this, a potential difference is established between the 2 plates. When the capacitor reaches its steady state condition, an electric current is unable to flow through due to the insulation of the dieletric.

Flow of electrons onto plates is known as the capacitors 'Charging Current' which flows until voltage across both plates (therefore the capacitor) is equal to the applied voltage (Vc). At this point, the capacitor is said to be 'fully charged' with electrons.
