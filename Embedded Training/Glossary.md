[Multiplexing:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) Method where many analog or digital signals are combined into 1 signal across a shared medium in order to share a physical transmission medium. 

Impedance: [Measure of opposition to electrical flow. In DC systems, impedance and resistance are the same.](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/glossary/impedance.html)[Opposition to alternating current presented by the combined effect of resistance and reactance in a circuit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance)

[FET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor#Basic_information): Type of transistor which uses an electric field to control the flow of current within a semiconductor. 

[MOSFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET): Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor. Type of field effect transistor (FET). Used to amplify or switch electronic signals. Digital ICs and memory devices contain a high volume of integrated MOSFETs in order to provide basic switching functions which are required for logic gates and data storage.

[NMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMOS_logic): N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor logic. Uses n-type MOSFETs to implement logic gates and digital circuits.

[PMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMOS_logic): P-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor. Family of digital circuits based on the p-channel, enhancement mode metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) which are used to implement logic gates etc.

CMOS: Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor. [Commonly used to hold the BIOS.](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/support/articles/000025368/processors.html) [Also used to build ICs such as microprocessors, micro-controllers, memory chips and so on. Other uses in image sensors, data converters, RF circuits and highly integrated transceivers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS)
